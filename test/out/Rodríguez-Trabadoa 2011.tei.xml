<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>To the Editor,</head><p><s>The mechanism leading to chronic urticaria often remains unclear.</s><s>Up to half of patients are thought to have functional circulating IgG auto antibodies against the high-affinity IgE receptor (FcRI␣) or, in a few cases, even against IgE. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref></s><s>hese antibodies are able to release histamine in vitro from basophils and mast cells.</s><s>The expression of the basophil activation marker CD63 can be induced in healthy subjects by chronic urticaria sera patients with positive autologous serum skin test (ASST). <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref></s><s>A lowering in the CD63 expression after cyclosporine treatment has been assessed. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref></s><s>The efficacy of omalizumab treatment has been shown in patients with chronic urticaria, <ref type="bibr">4 ---7</ref> and even in many ASS negative test patients. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref></s><s>e report the case of a 49-year-old female patient, who had suffered from chronic urticaria for 18 months.</s><s>The severity of the clinical condition progressively increased and soles angio-oedema was added in the last episodes.</s><s>The disease became uncontrolled despite high doses of antihistamines and low corticosteroid doses every 48 h, so many steroid cycles were required every month.</s><s>Taking into account that autoimmune aetiology is often related to severe urticaria cases, treatment with omalizumab was indicated.</s><s>Asthma doses for omalizumab were used.</s><s>In this case, 300 mg every two weeks was prescribed.</s><s>Steroid treatment was stopped one week after the first dose, and no new episodes occurred after the beginning of the treatment.</s><s>Skin prick tests were negative for aliments, latex, anisakis and positive for olea.</s></p><p><s>Autologous serum skin test was also negative.</s><s>Serum complement levels (C2, C4), gave normal results.</s></p><p><s>Proteinogram, serum immunoglobulins (IgA, IgG, IgM), thyroid function, haemogram and general biochemical serum tests were also normal.</s></p><p><s>The screening for autoimmune disease, including antithyroid antibodies, was negative.</s></p><p><s>Basophil activation test was performed before beginning the administration of omalizumab and after several doses of treatment, taking the serum of the patient as stimulus.</s><s>All the samples were drawn immediately before the next dose administration, thus two weeks after the treatment with omalizumab.</s><s>The test was performed with the blood of atopic and non-atopic donors without urticaria, employed to study their basophil response after confrontation with the serum of the patient.</s><s>Other tests were performed, taking the sera of patients with autoimmune disease as stimulus, to exclude other autoimmune conditions acting as confounding factors; and with the sera of patients with acute urticaria, to evaluate the autoimmune mechanism of chronic urticaria, in contrast with the acute condition.</s><s>Informed consent was obtained from the patient and the healthy donors.</s></p><p><s>The assay was performed in accord with the protocol previously described. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref></s><s>The percentage of basophils expressing CD63 with high affinity was the variable used to determine basophil activation.</s><s>Briefly, a heparinised blood sample was drawn from the donors and aliquotted to test several stimulus.</s><s>A stimulation buffer (containing IL-3) was first added for ten minutes.</s><s>Each sample was tested with a negative control (serum saline), a positive control (the chemotactic peptide N-formylmethionyl-leucyl-phenylanine, that induces basophil activation) and the different sera studied as stimulus.</s><s>A double blinding was carried out with CD203, to select the basophil population, and CD63, to detect its activation.</s><s>After a lysing and washing process, the analysis was performed by flow cytometry (approximately 800 basophils per sample).</s><s>The analysis gate was defined around cells showing high-density CD203c label and low side-scatter, identified as basophils.</s><s>For inhalants, the test result is considered positive when at least 15% of basophils become activated after the stimulus addition.</s></p><p><s>Before beginning the treatment, activation even higher than that induced by the positive control was seen in donors (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>).</s><s>After one, two, six and twelve doses of treatment, the activation induced by the serum patient decreased to values similar to the negative control or slightly higher than this.</s><s>In contrast, no evidence of significant activation was seen in donors in whom sera of healthy individuals or patients with autoimmune disease or urticaria were added.</s></p><p><s>We can conclude that: firstly, in this case, the BAT performed with the serum patient strongly suggested an autoimmune aetiology for the chronic urticaria process and a possible successful treatment with omalizumab.</s><s>Secondly, an early decrease in the serum-induced basophil activation coincided with a satisfactory clinical evolution.</s><s>Moreover, in ASST negative chronic urticaria patients, BAT could be an alternative method to check a possible autoimmune aetiology of the disease.</s><s>No previous cases of chronic urticaria patients following treatment with omalizumab and monitoring by BAT have been reported.</s></p><p><s>A.
